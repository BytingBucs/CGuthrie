# Shopping List Project Contributions
## Christopher Guthrie
## COP 2830 Internet Programming HTML II
### What I Contributed
My contribution to the final projects was the construction of the Cascading Style Sheet to enhance the aesthetics of our website.
This included creating a color palette that made the website flow together better than the previous yellow and red scheme.

### What I Learned
As I worked my way through the contruction of my CSS, I realized that it can be extremely difficult to make the content look exactly how you want without changing the code for the website or the javascript.
This helped me to find new ways to format information and to use other CSS elements that I may not have used otherwise.

## To Do
Outstanding items that need to be done:
- [x] Add an appealing button-hover effect
- [ ] Find a better way to format the sitemap
- [ ] More evenly space tabs
- [ ] Format the delete links (Currently marked as X)
